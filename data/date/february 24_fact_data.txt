February 24 is the 55th day of the year in the Gregorian calendar.  310 days remain until the end of the year (311 in leap years).
For superstitious reasons, when the Romans began to intercalate to bring their calendar into line with the solar year, they chose not to place their extra month of Mercedonius after February but within it.
