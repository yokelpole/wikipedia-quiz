August 10 is the 222nd day of the year (223rd in leap years) in the Gregorian calendar.  143 days remain until the end of the year.
The term 'the 10th of August' is widely used by historians as a shorthand for the Storming of the Tuileries Palace on the 10th of August, 1792, the effective end of the French monarchy until it was restored in 1814.
