Starting in 1996, American jam band Phish has hosted a series of festivalsâ€”ten in total, with attendance at around 85,000. They are typically the only band to perform at the festivals, although the 1998 Lemonwheel festival and 1999 Camp Oswego festival both featured a second stage for supporting acts.
