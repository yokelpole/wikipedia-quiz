The inaugural Anger Management Tour was founded and started in the fall of 2000 by Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, and after the release of The Marshall Mathers LP, Eminem. Originally targeted at both rap and rock fans, the first "Anger Management" outing took place in 2000. In the process of starting the large tour, Eminem wanted to include Nine Inch Nails into the list of artists, but Marilyn Manson joining the tour would raise the issues between him and Trent Reznor.
