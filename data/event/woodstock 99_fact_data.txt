Woodstock '99 (also called Woodstock 1999), held July 22â€“25, 1999, was the second large-scale music festival (after Woodstock '94) that attempted to emulate the original Woodstock festival of 1969. Like the previous Woodstock festivals, it was held in upstate New York, this time in Rome (roughly one hundred miles (160 km) from the site of the original event), and the attendance was approximately 400,000 over four days.
Cable network MTV covered the concert extensively and live coverage of the entire weekend was available on pay-per-view.
