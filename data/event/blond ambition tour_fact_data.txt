The Blond Ambition World Tour was the third concert tour by American singer Madonna. It supported her successful fourth studio album Like a Prayer (1989), and the soundtrack album to the 1990 film Dick Tracy, I'm Breathless (1990). Originally planned to be called "Like a Prayer World Tour", it was supposed to be sponsored by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, whom Madonna signed a deal with.
