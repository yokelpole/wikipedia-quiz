The Doomsday Festival was a two-day music festival held August 19â€“20, 2000, at the Ostragehege in Dresden, Germany. The event featured a wide range of bands, but is best known as the occasion of Skinny Puppy's reunion concert, which closed the festival and was recorded for the live album Doomsday: Back and Forth Series 5: Live in Dresden (2001). It was Skinny Puppy's first concert since 1992, first in Europe since 1988, and first ever in the former East Germany.
