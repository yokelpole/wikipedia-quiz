The US Festival (US pronounced like the pronoun, not as initials) was the name of two early 1980s music and culture festivals.


== Background ==
Steve Wozniak, cofounder of Apple and creator of the Apple I and Apple II personal computers, believed that the 1970s were the "Me" generation. He intended the US Festivals, with Bill Graham's participation, to encourage the 1980s to be more community-oriented and combine technology with rock music.
