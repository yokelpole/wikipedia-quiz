702 (pronounced "Seven-Oh-Two"), named after the area code of their hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada, is an American vocal girl group, with the final and most known line up consisting of Kameelah Williams and sisters Irish and LeMisha Grinstead.
The group was originally a quartet featuring the Grinstead sisters, which included identical twins Irish and Orish (born June 2, 1980 in Houston, TX), their older sister LeMisha (born June 10, 1978 in Houston, TX), and Amelia Childs whom they debuted as featured artists on Subway's hit single "This Lil' Game We Play". Amelia and Orish were removed from the group due to Mike Bivens not favoring their voices and were briefly replaced by classmates Tiffany Villarreal and Kameelah Williams.
