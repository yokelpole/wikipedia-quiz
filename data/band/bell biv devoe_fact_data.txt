Bell Biv DeVoe, also known as BBD, is an American music group formed from members of the New Edition, consisting of Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe.
The band is best known for their debut album, the multi-platinum selling Poison, a key work in the new jack swing movement of the 1990s that combined elements of traditional soul and R&B with hip hop.  Two singles from the album, "Poison" and "Do Me!", both reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1990.
