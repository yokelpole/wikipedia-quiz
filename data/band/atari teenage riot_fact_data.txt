Atari Teenage Riot (abbreviated ATR) is a German band formed in Berlin in 1992. The name is taken from a Portuguese Joe song entitled "Teenage Riot" from the album Teen-age Riot, with the word 'Atari' added as an Atari ST computer was used to create compositions. Highly political, they fuse left-wing, anarchist, anti-fascist views with punk vocals and a techno sound called digital hardcore, which is a term band member Alec Empire used as the name of his record label.
