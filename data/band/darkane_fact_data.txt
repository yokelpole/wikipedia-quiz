Darkane is a Swedish extreme metal band that originated in Helsingborg in 1998. Their music contains ample thrash elements interspersed with acoustic interludes and symphonic features, such as the in studio use of synthesizers and occasionally full orchestras and choir singing. The name Darkane is a portmanteau of the words "dark" and "arcane".
