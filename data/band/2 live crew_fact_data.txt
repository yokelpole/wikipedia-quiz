The 2 Live Crew was an American hip hop group from Miami, United States which had its greatest commercial success in the late 1980s to the early 1990s. Fronted by Luke Campbell, they were considerably controversial in the U.S. due to the sexually explicit and misogynistic content in their songs, particularly on their 1989 album As Nasty As They Wanna Be. They were frequently challenged for their sexually explicit lyrics.
