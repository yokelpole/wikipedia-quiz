The Music Band is an album by War, released on MCA Records in 1979.
In 1979, War considered changing its name to The Music Band, possibly regarding its old name as too aggressive for modern times.  (They had formed in 1969 during the Vietnam War.)  But by the time this album was released, they decided to keep the name War, and make "The Music Band" the title of a series of albums, of which this is the first.
