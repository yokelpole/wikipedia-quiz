Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll, rock 'n' roll, or rock 'n roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s from musical styles such as gospel, jump blues, jazz, boogie woogie, rhythm and blues, and country music. While elements of what was to become rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.According to journalist Greg Kot, "rock and roll" is a style of popular music originating in the U.S. in the 1950s. It is distinguished here from "the more encompassing international style known as "rock music" that developed by the mid-1960s, though the latter also continued to be known as rock and roll."In the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument, but these instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s.
