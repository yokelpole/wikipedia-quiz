"Maria" is a song by the American band Blondie, taken from their 1999 album No Exit. The band's first single release since "War Child" in July 1982, "Maria" marked Blondie's return to the charts after an almost 17-year absence. It reached number one in the United Kingdom; Blondie's sixth UK chart-topper (and their first since 1980).
