"Butterfly" is a pop song, written and recorded by the French singer-songwriter, Danyel GÃ©rard (born Gerard Daniel Khertakian, 7 March 1939, Paris) in the late 1960s. It was initially a hit in the French language.
In the early 1970s English language words were written, and Gerard recorded it again in the United States.
