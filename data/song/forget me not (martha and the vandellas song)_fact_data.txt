"Forget Me Not" is a 1968 single by Motown girl group Martha and the Vandellas (credited as Martha Reeves & the Vandellas). Though the song failed to ignite charts in America, barely hitting the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 93 (it was the b-side to their hit, "I Promise to Wait My Love") and failing to chart on the US R&B charts (a rarity for the group), it became a hit on the UK Singles Chart singles chart peaking at No.
