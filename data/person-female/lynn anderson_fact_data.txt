Lynn Rene Anderson (September 26, 1947 â€“ July 30, 2015) was an American country music singer known for a string of hits from the late 1960s to the 1980s, most notably her worldwide mega-hit "Rose Garden" (1970).  Anderson's crossover appeal and regular exposure on national television helped her become country music's first mainstream female superstar in the early 1970s; taking the genre to venues around the world that previously had not been receptive.  In 1970, she became the first female country star to appear on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and, in 1974, the first to headline and sellout Madison Square Garden in New York City.
