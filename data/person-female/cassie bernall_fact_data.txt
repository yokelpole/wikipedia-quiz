Cassie René Bernall (November 6, 1981 – April 20, 1999) was a student killed in the Columbine High School massacre, where 11 more students and a teacher were killed by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who then committed suicide. It was reported that Bernall had been asked whether or not she believed in God, and she said "Yes", before being shot during the massacre. However, Dave Cullen, in his book Columbine, concludes that the person asked about their belief in God was Valeen Schnurr, who survived the shooting.In September 2000, Bernall's mother, Misty, released the book She Said Yes: The Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie Bernall.
