BBC Radio 1 is one of the BBC's two flagship radio stations (the other being BBC Radio 2), specialising in modern popular music and current chart hits throughout the day. Radio 1 provides alternative genres at night, including electronica, dance, hip hop and indie. The choice of music and presenting style is entirely that of programme hosts; however, those who present in the daytime have to rotate a number of songs a specific number of times (8, 13 or 15) per week.
