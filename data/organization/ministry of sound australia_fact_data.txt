Ministry of Sound Australia is the Australian subsidiary label of Ministry of Sound Recordings Ltd, currently operating out of the offices of Sony Music Entertainment Australia.
In its previous separate incarnation known as Ministry of Sound (UK) Pty Ltd and then Ministry of Sound Australia Pty Ltd, it was Australia's largest dance music label as well as one of Australia's largest independent labels overall, being spun off into a separate independent company with exclusive licence to the Ministry of Sound trademarks in Australia & New Zealand in 2004. In 2016, after the announcement that the Ministry of Sound Group had sold Ministry of Sound Recordings to Sony Music Entertainment UK, Ministry of Sound Australia Managing Director Tim McGee announced that as a result the Australian operations would be forced to rebrand as TMRW Music Group, with all Ministry of Sound recordings-related IP in Australia to be handled by Sony Music Entertaiment Australia as of July 2017.
