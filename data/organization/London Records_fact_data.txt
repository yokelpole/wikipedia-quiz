London Records (or London Recordings) is a British record label that marketed records in the United States, Canada, and Latin America for Decca Records from 1947 to 1979 before becoming semi-independent.


== History ==

London arose from the split in ownership between the British and American branches of Decca Records. The American branch of London Records released British Decca records in the U.S. since British Decca could not use the "Decca" name there.
