The British honours system is a means of rewarding individuals' personal bravery, achievement, or service to the United Kingdom and the British Overseas Territories. The system consists of three types of award â€“ honours, decorations and medals:

Honours are used to recognise merit in terms of achievement and service;
Decorations tend to be used to recognise specific deeds;
Medals are used to recognise service on a particular operation or in a specific theatre, long or valuable service, and good conduct.Appointments to the various orders and awards of other honours are usually published in the London Gazette.


== Brief history ==
Although the Anglo-Saxon monarchs are known to have rewarded their loyal subjects with rings and other symbols of favour, it was the Normans who introduced knighthoods as part of their feudal government.
