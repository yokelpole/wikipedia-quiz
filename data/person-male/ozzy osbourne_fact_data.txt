John Michael "Ozzy" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English singer, songwriter, actor, and television personality. He rose to prominence during the 1970s as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, during which he adopted the nickname the "Prince of Darkness". Osbourne was fired from the band in 1979 due to alcohol and drug problems, but he went on to have a successful solo career, releasing 12 studio albums, the first seven of which were awarded multi-platinum certifications in the US. Osbourne has since reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions.
