Patrick McCarthy is an English conductor and singer.McCarthy trained as a baritone singer at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the London Opera Centre, and came to public attention in 1974, during a performance of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, conducted by Andr√© Previn at The Proms in the Royal Albert Hall.
McCarthy was in the audience when Thomas Allen (now Sir Thomas), the baritone soloist, fell ill during the performance, collapsing onto his chair and needing to be carried off by members of the orchestra. McCarthy went backstage and offered his services as a professional singer who was experienced with the piece.
