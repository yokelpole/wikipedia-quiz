=== Early years ===
As a youth growing up in Galion, Ohio, Morgan's interest was piqued while listening to his favorite DJs on Cleveland's top forty giant KYW (then on 1100 AM before they moved to Philadelphia) which would eventually lead to his first on-air job at Wooster College in 1955 on WWST & WWST-FM, for an initial salary of $1 per hour.
