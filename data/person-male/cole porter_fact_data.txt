Cole Albert Porter (June 9, 1891 â€“ October 15, 1964) was an American composer and songwriter. Many of his songs became standards noted for their witty, urbane lyrics, and many of his scores found success on Broadway and in film.
Born to a wealthy family in Indiana, Porter defied his grandfather's wishes and took up music as a profession.
