Wouter "Wally" De Backer (born 21 May 1980), known professionally as Gotye ( GOT-ee-ay), is a Belgian-born Australian multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter. The name "Gotye" is a pronunciation respelling of "Gauthier", the French cognate of Gotye's given Dutch name "Wouter" (English "Walter", hence the nickname "Wally").
Gotye has released three studio albums independently and one album featuring remixes of tracks from his first two albums.
