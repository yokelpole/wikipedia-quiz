Diamond Dogs is the eighth studio album by English singer-songwriter David Bowie, released on 24 May 1974 by RCA Records. Produced by Bowie himself and recorded in early 1974 at Olympic and Island Studios in London and Ludolph Studios in the Netherlands, it was Bowie's first album since 1970 to not feature contributions from his backing band the Spiders from Mars â€“ comprising Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey. Thematically, it is a marriage of the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell and Bowie's own glam-tinged vision of a post-apocalyptic world.
