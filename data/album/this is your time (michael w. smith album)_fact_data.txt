This Is Your Time is Michael W. Smith's fourteenth studio album, released on November 23, 1999.

== Background ==
The title track was inspired by the initial news report that Columbine shooting victim Cassie Bernall was killed for answering "yes" to the question "Do you believe in God?" Smith co-wrote the song with Wes King, having enlisted his help knowing that he wanted to write about Columbine but did not want to exploit a tragedy.
