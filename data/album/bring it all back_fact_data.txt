Bringing It All Back Home (known as Subterranean Homesick Blues in some European countries) is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. It was released on March 22, 1965, by Columbia Records.
The album features an electric half of songs, followed by a mostly acoustic half, while abandoning the protest music of Dylan's previous records in favor of more surreal, complex lyrics.
