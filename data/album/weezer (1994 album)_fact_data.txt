Weezer (commonly known as the Blue Album) is the eponymous debut studio album by American rock band Weezer, released on May 10, 1994 by DGC Records. The album came two years after the band's founding, after they initially struggled as an alternative to grunge music, which was prevalent in Los Angeles during the early 1990s. It was almost entirely arranged and composed by frontman Rivers Cuomo, who also anticipated to lead the band in self-producing the album.
