On the Border is the third studio album by American rock group the Eagles, released in 1974. Apart from two songs produced by Glyn Johns, it was produced by Bill Szymczyk because the group wanted a more rockâ€‘oriented sound instead of the country-rock feel of the first two albums. It is the first Eagles album to feature guitarist Don Felder.
