Latium ( LAY-shee-əm, US also  -⁠shəm, Latin: [ˈlat̪i.ʊ̃ˑ]) is the region of central western Italy and the entirety of Vatican City in which the city of Rome was founded and grew to be the capital city of the Roman Empire. Latium was originally a small triangle of fertile, volcanic soil on which resided the tribe of the Latins or Latians. It was located on the left bank (east and south) of the River Tiber, extending northward to the River Anio (a left-bank tributary of the Tiber) and southeastward to the Pomptina Palus (Pontine Marshes, now the Pontine Fields) as far south as the Circeian promontory.
