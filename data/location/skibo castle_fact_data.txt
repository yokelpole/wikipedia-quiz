Skibo Castle (Scottish Gaelic: Caisteal Sg√¨obail) is located to the west of Dornoch in the Highland county of Sutherland, Scotland overlooking the Dornoch Firth. Although largely of the 19th century, and early 20th century, when it was the home of industrialist Andrew Carnegie, its origins go back much earlier.
It is now operated as The Carnegie Club, a members-only residential club, offering members and their guests accommodation in both the castle and estate lodges, a private links golf course and a range of activities including clay pigeon shooting, tennis and horse riding.
