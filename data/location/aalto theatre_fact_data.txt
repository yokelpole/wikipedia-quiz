The Aalto Theatre (Aalto-Theater) is a performing arts venue in Essen, Germany, and is home to the city's opera company Aalto-Musiktheater, ballet company Aalto Ballett Theater and orchestra Essener Philharmoniker. It opened on 25 September 1988 with Richard Wagner's opera Die Meistersinger von NÃ¼rnberg and is mainly used for opera and ballet, but also for concerts and galas.
The design by the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto was the unanimous winner in a competition in 1959, but the building was begun only in 1983, seven years after Aalto's death.
