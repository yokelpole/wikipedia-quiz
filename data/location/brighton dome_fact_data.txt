The Brighton Dome is an arts venue in Brighton, England, that contains the Concert Hall, the Corn Exchange and the Studio Theatre (formerly the Pavilion Theatre). All three venues are linked to the rest of the Royal Pavilion Estate by a tunnel to the Royal Pavilion in Pavilion Gardens and through shared corridors to Brighton Museum.

The Concert Hall and Riding School (now the Corn Exchange) were built for the Prince Regent (later George IV) and work started in 1803 to the designs of William Porden.
