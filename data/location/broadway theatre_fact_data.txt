Broadway theatre, also known simply as Broadway, refers to the theatrical performances presented in the 41 professional theatres, each with 500 or more seats, located in the Theater District and Lincoln Center along Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Broadway and London's West End together represent the highest commercial level of live theater in the English-speaking world.  While the thoroughfare itself has become eponymous with the district and its collection of 41 theatres, only three of the theatres are physically located on Broadway itself (being the Broadway Theatre, the Palace Theatre, and the Winter Garden Theatre), the rest are located on the numbered cross streets extending from the Nederlander Theatre one block south of Times Square on West 41st Street, north along either side of Broadway to the Vivian Beaumont Theater, located outside of the Theater District on West 65th street, with the highest concentration of theaters located between 42nd Street (Times Square) and 49th Street.
